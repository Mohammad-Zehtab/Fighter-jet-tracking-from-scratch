# fighter-jet-tracking
this is a Python script for processing a video, particularly aimed at detecting and visualizing contours of a fighter jet within each frame of the video. 
this script processes a video by enhancing it, detecting edges, finding contours, and visualizing these contours with green lines. It then saves the processed frames as a new video called "result.mp4." This code can be beneficial for various computer vision applications such as object detection and tracking.
